# Laboratory-Data-Extraction
This code is used to show how I connected to two different databases for data extraction of laboratory data.
The resulting data is used to visaulize the quality of data being produced from the lab by laboratory staff. The R script is programmed to run as a cron job twice a day to make sure data can be visualized on the same day experiment was performed.
